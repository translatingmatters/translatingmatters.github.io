          You have a document in French that you need in perfect English,
          but the content is a little technical or commercial.
          Look no further! I am a qualified translator, with experience in business and engineering.
          Whether you need punchy copy to spread the word about the fabulous services
          or products you have on offer,
          you want to publish an academic article on your ideas or
          you need to draft technical specifications for your project,
          I can help transform your text,
          accurately conveying your meaning in a way that is clear and relevant to an English-speaking audience.
        </p>

        <p class="tc b lh-title">Editing</p>
        <p class="lh-copy">
          Perhaps you have already written your ideas in English.
          You know that you have used the right industry-specific vocabulary,
          but you would like someone to check the grammar and style of your writing before publishing it
          for an English-speaking audience. Send it my way and I’ll make sure the end result is absolutely flawless.

          <span class="db b lh-title">About me</span>
          My name is Lucy O’Shea and I operate as a freelance translator in Spain.
          You may contact me in my capacity as the data controller
          by writing to oshealeo@gmail.com or lucy@translatingmatters.co.uk.
          <span class="pt2 db b lh-title">Why I collect, process and store your personal data:</span>
          I collect, use and store your personal data to communicate with you, issue a quote,
          provide a translation or revision service that you request or to comply with legal requirements
          such as those stipulated by the Spanish tax authorities.
          Personal data collected may include your name, postal address,
          email address, telephone number and ID or tax number.
          Personal data may also include data within special categories that you send me to be translated,
          revised or edited. I do not use your personal data for marketing purposes.</br>
          The legal basis for processing your data is to perform the services you request
          or to take necessary steps prior to fulfilling that request (GDPR 6(1b)).
          The legal basis for processing special categories of personal data, where applicable,
          is your explicit consent for me to translate, revise or edit that information (GDPR 6(1a)).

          <span class="pt2 db b lh-title">Who else receives your personal data:</span>
          If I send a text for revision or editing to a colleague,
          that text will be anonymised, so that your personal data will not appear in it.
          For administrative purposes, other parties may have access to your personal data,
          including my accountant and cloud backup system.

          <span class="pt2 db b lh-title">How long I keep your personal data:</span>
          In the case of quotes, I delete all personal data after one year.
          In the case of services rendered, I keep personal data for five years to comply with tax obligations
          and for up to ten years for translation reference purposes when the personal data form part of the text itself.
          I delete email communications after five years.

          <span class="pt2 db b lh-title">Your data access rights:</span>
          You may contact me at any time to request a copy, rectification or erasure of your personal data.
          I will act without undue delay and within one month of receipt of the request.

          <span class="pt2 db b lh-title"> Your right to lodge a complaint:</span>
          Should you have any concerns about how I process your personal data, please contact me.
          You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in Spain or in the country where you live.


          <span class="db pt2">This Privacy Notice was updated in May 2018. I will review and update it when necessary.</span>
